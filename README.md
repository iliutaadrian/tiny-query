## üöÄ Features
- üîç Explore SQLite databases with ease
- üìä Execute custom queries with WHERE clauses
- üîÄ Sort results by any column, ascending or descending
- üñ•Ô∏è Tmux integration for quick access
- ALL FROM CLI

## üõ† Installation

1. Clone the repository to your home directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/iliutaadrian/tiny-query.git ~/.tinyquery
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ~/.tinyquery
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file (or `~/.bashrc` if you're using bash):
   ```
   alias query='python $HOME/.tinyquery/app.py'
   ```

5. Reload your shell configuration:
   ```
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

6. For tmux integration, add the following line to your `.tmux.conf`:
   ```
   bind-key q run-shell 'tmux neww "cd #{pane_current_path}; ~/.tinyquery/tmux_launcher.sh"'
   ```

## üñ• Usage

After setting up the global alias, you can run TinyQuery from anywhere using:

```
query --db path/to/your/database.db
```

Replace `path/to/your/database.db` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.

### Tmux Launcher

If you've set up the tmux integration, you can quickly launch TinyQuery in a new tmux window by pressing `prefix + q`. This will open a new window with TinyQuery, allowing you to select a database file using fzf.
